            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
            describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
            language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
            Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
            content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can
            improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control
            in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
            multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant
            CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition
            in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to
            improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
            and its formatting.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to
              present the same markup page in different styles for different
              rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
              speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
              tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
              the content is accessed on a mobile device.
            </li>
            <li>
              The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web
              Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is
              registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C
              operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

            The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The
            declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by
            semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a
            value, separated by a colon. Multiple CSS declarations are separated
            with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly
            braces.

                }

            <li>
              Here, p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you
              want to style). color is a property, and red is the property value
              text-align is a property, and center is the property value

            Each web browser uses a layout engine to render web pages, and
            support for CSS functionality is not consistent between them.
            Because browsers do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding
            techniques have been developed to target specific browsers with
            workarounds (commonly known as CSS hacks or CSS filters). Adoption
            of new functionality in CSS can be hindered by lack of support in
            major browsers. For example, Internet Explorer was slow to add
            support for many CSS 3 features, which slowed adoption of those
            features and damaged the browser's reputation among developers.[62]
            In order to ensure a consistent experience for their users, web
            developers often test their sites across multiple operating systems,
            browsers, and browser versions, increasing development time and
            complexity. Tools such as BrowserStack have been built to reduce the
            complexity of maintaining these environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to these testing tools, many sites maintain lists of
            browser support for specific CSS properties, including CanIUse and
            the MDN Web Docs. Additionally, the CSS 3 defines feature queries,
            which provide an @supports directive that will allow developers to
            target browsers with support for certain functionality directly
            within their CSS.[63] CSS that is not supported by older browsers
            can also sometimes be patched in using JavaScript polyfills, which
            are pieces of JavaScript code designed to make browsers behave
            consistently. These workarounds—and the need to support fallback
            functionality—can add complexity to development projects, and
            consequently, companies frequently define a list of browser versions
            that they will and will not support.
          </p>
          <p>
            As websites adopt newer code standards that are incompatible with
            older browsers, these browsers can be cut off from accessing many of
            the resources on the web (sometimes intentionally).[64] Many of the
            most popular sites on the internet are not just visually degraded on
            older browsers due to poor CSS support, but do not work at all, in
            large part due to the evolution of JavaScript and other web
            technologies.

            Some noted limitations of the current capabilities of CSS include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Selectors are unable to ascend</li>
            <p>
              CSS currently offers no way to select a parent or ancestor of an
              element that satisfies certain criteria.[65] CSS Selectors Level
              4, which is still in Working Draft status, proposes such a
              selector,[66] but only as part of the complete "snapshot" selector
              profile, not the fast "live" profile used in dynamic CSS
              styling.[67] A more advanced selector scheme (such as XPath) would
              enable more sophisticated style sheets. The major reasons for the
              CSS Working Group previously rejecting proposals for parent
              selectors are related to browser performance and incremental
              rendering issues.
            </p>
            <li>
              Cannot explicitly declare new scope independently of position
            </li>
            <p>
              Scoping rules for properties such as z-index look for the closest
              parent element with a position:absolute or position:relative
              attribute. This odd coupling has undesired effects. For example,
              it is impossible to avoid declaring a new scope when one is forced
              to adjust an element's position, preventing one from using the
              desired scope of a parent element.
            </p>
            <li>Cannot include styles from a rule into another rule</li>
            <p>
              CSS styles often must be duplicated in several rules to achieve a
              desired effect, causing additional maintenance and requiring more
              thorough testing. Some new CSS features were proposed to solve
              this, but were abandoned afterwards.[70][71] Instead, authors may
              gain this ability by using more sophisticated stylesheet languages
              which compile to CSS, such as Sass, Less, or Stylus.
